# Refractor-Project
This is a description of an existing code and uploading on Github with the link.
My motivation was to learn how to apply css on html to understand the code and how it refactored.
I want to be able to understand how to upload repository.
I want to master on how to upload repositories on github with no effort and help in the future.


I learned how to make a repository on github and how to push the code.
I learned that certain changes you make on css can effect the web html.
